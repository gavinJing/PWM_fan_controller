# PWM_fan_controller
A smart fan controller use a STM32 MCU to cooling a LED light . The controller have 3 main function. 1.A GPIO generate a 25KHz PWM signal to control the fan speed. 2.The fan speed increase with temperature increasing. 3.When the temperature over 80 degress celsius, a buzzer sound. When the tmeperature over 100 degress celsius, the LED light power will be cut off
